A showcase of my projects, abilities and creativity in programming

Iris Data Machine Learning Model
---------------------------
Created a machine learning model to predict the species of an iris flower given certain data on the sample flower's features. I split the data into 'train' and 'test' groups, and then used the 'K-Neighbours Classifier' to create a machine learning model that was trained on this data. The model has an accuracy of 95%.

FIFA-19 Value Scout
---------------------------
A programme that incorporates data science methods to analyse the value and wages of football players on FIFA-19 and return the optimal players for a club to sign. The pandas library is used to clean and organise data by the gap between the value and wage of a player. I then used the seaborn library to visualise this data on a scatterplot, building  a feature to hover over points on the scatterplot to reveal further information about each player.

Hacker News Website Scraper
---------------------------

Data scraping programme that uses Hacker News' API and the 'requests' library to retrieve the latest news from the Hacker News website. BeautifulSoup is then used to parse the HTML content to extract important story titles, URLs and votes. The script then filters and returns the most popular articles, sorting them in descending order

Password Checker
----------------

A powerful script to check the strength of a given password. Uses APIs and SHA-1 Hashing to securely compare inputted passwords with a database to determine the frequency that password is used. Based on this, it determines the strength of the password

JPG to PNG Converter
--------------------

A programme that converts images from JPG to PNG and stores them in a newly created folder. The function accepts a folder of JPG images and the name of the new folder as arguments
